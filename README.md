# Styled-Calculator
## Description
A web based calculator UI with a mobile fist design.

## Feature
- Calculator UI
- Theme selector
- Basic calculation capability (additions, subtractions)
- Sucket for calculation logic integration (readInput, showResult)

#### Assumptions:
- The calculation logic is implemented by a team member which will be integrated with the UI

### Technical Choices justification
The calculator is written purely in Javascript being a UI focused project with low complexities.
The choice of a table for the calculator buttons layout provided benefits like responsiveness and the possibility of manipulating the table styles.

### Development Aproach
An Iterative programming model was adopted, firstly laying out the individual components then updating them to meet the requirements further down the development lane.

### Programming paradigm
Choosing Procedural programming came in handy allowing for breaking down the programming task into a collection of variables, data structures, and subroutines.
